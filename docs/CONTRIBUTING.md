# Contributing

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Follow existing style, formatting, and naming conventions for the file you are modifying and for the entire project.
Please review the following guidelines before you get started

## Code Style

- Follow the PEP 8 standards for Python
- Variable and function names should be unique and reflect their purpose
- Class names should start with a capital letter
- Add comments to complex code.
- Use flake8 and black to check and automatically format code

##  Function Annotation

- The Python typing module is used to annotate types for functions and variables.
- Annotate the types of all functions, methods, arguments, and return values, as well as variables, where possible and appropriate.

- Using:
  - **str**, **int**, **float**, and **bool** to annotate simple data types.
  - **List**, **Tuple**, **Dict**, and **Set** from the typing module to annotate collections.
  - Union to indicate that a variable can have one of several types.
  - Callable to annotate functions as types.
  - Ð’ocstrings to describe the purpose of a function, its arguments, and its return value.


## ArgParse annotation

- Use ArgParse for all scripts that need the user to interact with the command line.
- Using:
  - Create an ArgumentParser object.
  - Describe what the script does in the description
  - Use the *add_argument()* method to define the arguments that your script will accept.

    The options for *add_argument()* :
    - *name or flags*: The name of the argument or a list of flags (e.g., -o, --output).
    - *help*: A short description of the argument to be displayed in the help.
    - *type*: The expected data type of the argument (e.g., str, int, float).
    - *default*: The default value of the argument.
    - *required*: Specify True if the argument is required.
    - *choices*: A list of acceptable values for the argument.
    - *action*: Specifies the action to perform when this argument is detected on the command line.
      
  - Calling the parse_args() method to parse command line arguments

## Base Packages

The following basic packages are required to work on the project: 

- python (version 3.9 or higher)
- pytest (for running tests)
- flake8 (for code style checking)
- black (for automatic code formatting)
- requests (for working with HTTP requests)
- pandas (for data analysis)
- numpy (for data analysis)

The minimum list of packages and their versions that are required for the project can be found in requirements/minimal.txt

## Install packeges 

- Each package is installed using conda. Save the installation code in repository. 

- The repository contains a separate YAML files that lists the dependencies and the versions used. A list of Conda packages and channels to install is contained in the environment.yaml file.

## SnakeMake wraps

- The enviromental.yaml file for each rule must be stacked in the Snakefile so that Snakemake can create an isolated conda environment with the necessary dependencies to run that rule.

## Folder structure

Use the following folder structure

- src/: Framework source code:
  - Contains modules and packages that implement the functionality of the framework. Each module should have a unique name and contain docstrings.

- tests/: Tests.
  - Contains tests for every module in src/.
  - The pytest library is used to write and execute the tests. Test filenames start with test_.

- docs/: Documentation
  - Includes a file with the contributor rules 

- examples/: Usage examples.
  - Contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the framework.

- requirements/: packages 
  - contains a set of minimum required packages 

- scripts/: Basic project scripts for execution.

- Code generated during development, testing, build/compile should be in .gitignore

## Execute through a Python or Bash layer

- Use Python or Bash scripts to execute the framework

## Pull Requests

- Describe changes made in the PR description clearly and in detail.
- Verify that all tests pass before submitting the PR.
- Update documentation if you make changes to the code.
  
For function annotation, use the Callable object from the typing module.
